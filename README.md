ScrapeStudio is a free, open-source, bilingual no-code studio for extracting structured data from supported public static web pages.

It combines a security-focused fetch gateway with detached browser-side parsing, editable multi-field recipes, safe exports, local history, starter-code generation, and bounded repeated-structure detection. No account is required.

> **Release status:** the free public release is live at [scrapestudio.pages.dev](https://scrapestudio.pages.dev/en), backed by the guarded Cloudflare Worker deployment documented in this repository.

## Try ScrapeStudio in three steps

1. Open the bundled [product playground](https://scrapestudio.pages.dev/en/playground/products).
2. Select **Analyze this demo**. ScrapeStudio loads the bundled HTML into the workspace without requesting an external site or consuming public fetch quota.
3. Review the quick results, open **Custom extractor**, choose **Use demo recipe**, and run it. You can then save the recipe locally or export the result as JSON or CSV.

Designed and built by [Pouya Fereydouni](https://github.com/pouya-fr00) as a production-minded full-stack portfolio project · [Personal Website](https://pouyafereydouni.ir)

## The problem

Useful data is often present in ordinary public HTML, but extracting it still tends to require one of two poor fits:

- a developer tool that assumes scraping and selector knowledge; or
- a hosted service that introduces accounts, remote data storage, opaque limits, or unnecessary automation.

ScrapeStudio provides a smaller and more transparent path: securely retrieve bounded static HTML, analyze it in the browser, review the result, and export only what is needed.

## What it can do

- Extract tables, links, images, headings, document metadata, JSON-LD, and page statistics.
- Build multi-field CSS selector recipes with eight extraction modes and live match counts.
- Detect promising repeated structures in a bounded Web Worker and turn them into editable recipes.
- Export stable JSON and UTF-8 CSV with spreadsheet-formula mitigation.
- Generate starter Python or JavaScript/Node code from an active recipe.
- Save recipes and lightweight history locally in IndexedDB.
- Switch between Persian RTL and English LTR without reloading.
- Present dedicated mobile result cards instead of compressing desktop tables.
- Test everything against original bundled product, table, and article playground pages.

## Built-in playground

The playground is the fastest way to review ScrapeStudio without relying on an external website or consuming public fetch quota:

- `/en/playground/products` and `/fa/playground/products` — twelve repeated product cards;
- `/en/playground/table` and `/fa/playground/table` — an eight-row community schedule;
- `/en/playground/article` and `/fa/playground/article` — headings, prose, metadata, an image record, a link, and JSON-LD.

Each visible demo can load the same bundled semantic HTML directly into the workspace with no network request. See [Playground and public documentation](docs/PLAYGROUND_AND_PUBLIC_DOCS.md).

## Architecture

  W --> V["URL and redirect validation"]
  V -->|"bounded HTML only"| P["Public static page"]
  P --> W

  Q --> R["Review and safe export"]
  S --> R
  R --> I["Local IndexedDB recipes and lightweight history"]
```

The backend owns the security-sensitive network boundary. General DOM parsing and repeated-structure analysis stay client-side. Fetched HTML is not persisted by the server and is never injected into the live application DOM.

## Security boundary

The public fetcher enforces:

- HTTP and HTTPS only;
- no embedded URL credentials;
- blocked localhost, private/reserved networks, and cloud metadata targets;
- restricted ports and manual validation of every redirect;
- one overall timeout, a response-size ceiling, and HTML-only content types;
- anonymous short-window and daily limits;
- privacy-safe logging without full sensitive query strings.

ScrapeStudio does not provide credentialed scraping, private-page access, CAPTCHA bypass, anti-bot bypass, proxy rotation, cookie import, arbitrary browser automation, or unlimited crawling. Read [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and the in-product `/en/security` or `/fa/security` page for details.

## Privacy and local data

- Fetched HTML is ephemeral and is not stored by the server.
- Result rows are not written to history.
- Recipes and lightweight activity history stay in the current browser.
- There is no account database in the current release.
- Recipe JSON is the portable backup format.

## Technology

- React 19, TypeScript, Vite, React Router, i18next
- Cloudflare Workers, Hono, Zod, SQLite-backed Durable Objects
- Framework-independent extraction and code-generation packages
- Vitest, Testing Library, ESLint, Prettier, GitHub Actions
- Self-hosted Vazirmatn variable font for the Persian interface

## Run locally

Requirements: Node.js 24 or newer and pnpm 11.7 or newer.

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @scrapestudio/api dev
pnpm --filter @scrapestudio/web dev
```

Default local services:

- web application: `http://127.0.0.1:5173/en` or `http://127.0.0.1:5173/fa`;
- Worker API health: `http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/v1/health`.

The web development server proxies API requests to the local Worker. Use the playground if you want a deterministic no-network product review.

## Quality gate

```bash
pnpm check
```

The combined gate rejects private/environment files, validates the manual-only deployment policy and browser security policy, checks documentation and formatting, runs lint and strict TypeScript validation, executes unit, integration, E2E, and accessibility tests, audits dependencies, builds every workspace package, and enforces bundle budgets. The Worker build is a Wrangler dry run and does not deploy.

Published product releases are versioned through Git tags and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md); the current public release is [`v1.0.0`](https://github.com/pouya-fr00/ScrapeStudio/releases/tag/v1.0.0). The workspace packages intentionally remain private at `0.0.0` because they are not published independently.
