## Automated evidence

- [CI run 29315174898](https://github.com/pouya-fr00/ScrapeStudio/actions/runs/29315174898) completed successfully on the release commit. Its quality-gate job covered the repository's private-file, security, deployment-policy, formatting, lint, type, unit, integration, end-to-end, accessibility, dependency-audit, build, bundle-budget, and documentation-link steps.
- [Production deployment run 29315309023](https://github.com/pouya-fr00/ScrapeStudio/actions/runs/29315309023) completed successfully on the same commit. The job ran the complete quality gate, validated protected production configuration, deployed the Worker and Pages artifacts, and completed the production smoke-test step.

The [published release notes](https://github.com/pouya-fr00/ScrapeStudio/releases/tag/v1.0.0) preserve the release-time test totals and highlight summary. This document does not restate those numbers as current results.

## Published endpoints

The release notes and deployment runbook identify these production endpoints:

- English application: <https://scrapestudio.pages.dev/en>
- Persian application: <https://scrapestudio.pages.dev/fa>
- Bundled product playground: <https://scrapestudio.pages.dev/en/playground/products>
- API health: <https://scrapestudio-api.pooya-fr2005.workers.dev/api/v1/health>

All four endpoints returned HTTP 200 when rechecked on 2026-07-17. The successful production workflow is the retained release-time evidence; a later availability check does not guarantee uninterrupted service.
