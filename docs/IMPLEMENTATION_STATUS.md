- Route-level lazy loading for workspace, local-data, playground, and documentation surfaces so the expanded public content does not inflate the main production bundle unnecessarily.
- Maintainer-facing `README.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and playground/public-documentation notes that accurately describe the live free release and its deployment boundary.
- Playwright critical-flow coverage for locale/direction switching, mobile focus management, no-network table analysis, custom extraction, JSON download, local recipe save/reopen, history creation, and history clearing.

| 2026-07-14 | Pin TypeScript 6.0.3 instead of 7.0.2                 | Current stable `typescript-eslint` supports TypeScript below 6.1.                                                                                    |
| 2026-07-14 | Use Vitest `projects` configuration                   | The earlier workspace configuration is deprecated.                                                                                                   |
| 2026-07-14 | Require a 24-hour minimum dependency release age      | Reduces exposure to newly published supply-chain compromises.                                                                                        |
| 2026-07-14 | Keep the Phase 0 web UI intentionally minimal         | Full localized UX begins in Phase 1; no temporary unlocalized product copy is introduced.                                                            |
| 2026-07-14 | Use explicit `/en` and `/fa` route prefixes           | Produces stable, shareable localized URLs without surprising redirects after selection.                                                              |
| 2026-07-14 | Bundle i18next resources in the web app               | Avoids a runtime translation network dependency and enables deterministic parity tests.                                                              |
| 2026-07-14 | Use Tailwind CSS through its first-party Vite plugin  | Matches the current official integration and keeps the design foundation build-time only.                                                            |
| 2026-07-14 | Implement the theme provider internally               | The three required modes need little code and do not justify another runtime dependency.                                                             |
| 2026-07-14 | Keep external fetching disabled in Phase 1            | The public UI must not expose URL fetching before the Phase 2 security controls pass.                                                                |
| 2026-07-14 | Keep extraction out of the Worker                     | The free Worker performs only security-sensitive network access; DOM parsing remains a later client-side concern.                                    |
| 2026-07-14 | Use `ipaddr.js` for address classification            | A mature parser provides explicit range classification for IPv4, IPv6, mapped, and transition forms.                                                 |
| 2026-07-14 | Use one SQLite Durable Object per hashed identity     | Object isolation plus a pure fixed-window policy keeps quota updates small, testable, and free of raw IP persistence.                                |
| 2026-07-14 | Require a deployment-specific identity salt           | Missing or weak configuration fails closed instead of creating predictable persisted identifiers.                                                    |
| 2026-07-14 | Enable `global_fetch_strictly_public`                 | Cloudflare's public fetch path complements application checks for literal addresses and redirects.                                                   |
| 2026-07-14 | Isolate extraction in a framework-independent package | Pure domain functions keep React out of parsing logic and make fixture behavior deterministic and reusable.                                          |
| 2026-07-14 | Return serializable collection envelopes              | Total, returned, and truncation counts let later responsive UI explain limits without retaining remote DOM nodes.                                    |
| 2026-07-14 | Resolve against final URL plus valid `<base>`         | This follows browser URL semantics while preserving the fetched page origin for internal/external classification.                                    |
| 2026-07-14 | Bound table spans, rows, columns, and table count     | Practical normalization remains useful without allowing pathological markup to create unbounded client work.                                         |
| 2026-07-14 | Use original local HTML fixtures                      | Core extraction tests remain deterministic, legally clean, and independent from live third-party websites.                                           |
| 2026-07-14 | Validate API envelopes again in the browser           | The network boundary remains untrusted even though the Worker already owns a typed response contract.                                                |
| 2026-07-14 | Ship a bundled original workspace demo                | Reviewers can verify the end-to-end workflow without depending on an external website or spending fetch quota.                                       |
| 2026-07-14 | Render remote image metadata without image elements   | Result inspection must not disclose user activity to third-party image hosts or trigger unbounded media downloads.                                   |
| 2026-07-14 | Use tables on desktop and record cards on mobile      | Mobile users receive a readable first-class result layout instead of a compressed wide table.                                                        |
| 2026-07-14 | Keep custom selector logic in extraction core         | Selector validation and extraction remain pure, reusable, fixture-tested domain behavior rather than React logic.                                    |
| 2026-07-14 | Validate every custom field independently             | One malformed selector is reported locally and cannot crash or hide otherwise valid fields.                                                          |
| 2026-07-14 | Support sanitized HTML as text-only output            | The required advanced mode stays useful without creating a remote markup injection or media-loading path.                                            |
| 2026-07-14 | Cap multiple values at 100 per field and item         | This bounds result growth beyond the required item and field limits while exposing truncation to the user.                                           |
| 2026-07-14 | Defer persistence of recipe drafts to Phase 6         | Phase 5 creates and runs a recipe; IndexedDB storage, import, and export remain in their specified phase.                                            |
| 2026-07-14 | Self-host Vazirmatn for the Persian interface         | A dedicated OFL-licensed variable font makes Persian readable without adding a runtime font request or changing technical text.                      |
| 2026-07-14 | Keep interface motion restrained and optional         | Short reveals and micro-interactions add hierarchy and feedback while `prefers-reduced-motion` keeps the experience accessible.                      |
| 2026-07-14 | Use a small native IndexedDB abstraction              | The required two local stores do not justify another runtime dependency, and an injected memory implementation keeps behavior easy to test.          |
| 2026-07-14 | Import recipes with new local identifiers             | A valid imported bundle cannot silently overwrite an existing recipe that happens to share an ID.                                                    |
| 2026-07-14 | Prefix spreadsheet-formula CSV cells with apostrophes | Values beginning with optional whitespace and `=`, `+`, `-`, or `@` remain visible while avoiding formula execution in common spreadsheet tools.     |
| 2026-07-14 | Generate code in a framework-independent package      | Deterministic templates and syntax checks remain reusable, fixture-driven, and isolated from React presentation state.                               |
| 2026-07-14 | Use LinkeDOM only in the generated Node starter       | Its documented `parseHTML` API supplies a detached DOM without adding a runtime parser dependency to ScrapeStudio itself.                            |
| 2026-07-14 | Redact likely-secret URL query values                 | Active page URLs can contain sensitive parameters; generated source must not silently copy those values into files or the Clipboard.                 |
| 2026-07-14 | Replace the native theme select with a custom listbox | Native option popups cannot be styled reliably and produced unreadable, visually inconsistent Persian dark-theme output.                             |
| 2026-07-14 | Send a compact DOM snapshot to the detection Worker   | Web Workers lack the required live DOM parser surface; a bounded serializable snapshot keeps remote HTML detached and transfer costs predictable.    |
| 2026-07-14 | Treat detection confidence as a relative score        | The heuristic is explainable but not statistically calibrated, so UI and documentation never present it as AI or guaranteed probability.             |
| 2026-07-14 | Skip synchronous fallback after a Worker timeout      | A timeout is a hard performance boundary; quick and custom extraction remain responsive instead of repeating work on the main thread.                |
| 2026-07-14 | Lazy-load detector UI, runtime, and Worker            | Smart analysis starts only after a result and does not push the main production chunk past its warning budget.                                       |
| 2026-07-14 | Use an opaque full-screen menu on mobile              | Navigation remains legible above page content, owns the small-screen interaction space, and can isolate background content accessibly.               |
| 2026-07-14 | Publish only verified creator links                   | The owner's GitHub profile is confirmed; a personal website or additional social profiles will not be guessed and require exact owner-provided URLs. |
| 2026-07-14 | Generate visible and analyzed demos from one catalog  | A single typed, localized source prevents the public sample page and detached extraction fixture from drifting apart.                                |
| 2026-07-14 | Use a reserved synthetic host for demo result URLs    | Demo links behave like realistic absolute URLs while the workspace explicitly avoids every network request for bundled playground content.           |
| 2026-07-14 | Lazy-load product and documentation route groups      | Phase 9 adds substantial public copy and UI; route boundaries keep the initial application chunk below the prior Vite warning threshold.             |
| 2026-07-14 | Defer absolute production origin artifacts            | Canonical metadata uses the current origin locally; sitemap and final public-origin verification require the owner-approved Phase 11 destination.    |
| 2026-07-14 | Use Playwright plus axe for the release E2E gate      | The required real-browser flows and common WCAG violations are verified together while manual accessibility review remains explicitly documented.    |
| 2026-07-14 | Keep the CI browser gate on Chromium                  | One current engine covers the specified critical E2E flows without multiplying public free-tier CI cost; responsive QA separately covers key widths. |
| 2026-07-14 | Reject inline style mutation in production source     | The deployed CSP must be executable in practice, so theme, scrolling, mobile overflow, and demo color behavior use data attributes and CSS classes.  |
| 2026-07-14 | Enforce conservative uncompressed bundle budgets      | Stable numeric gates catch major dependency or code-splitting regressions before gzip can hide their parse and execution cost.                       |

### Phase 11 — 2026-07-14 — complete

- Revalidated Cloudflare Pages Direct Upload, Wrangler, Worker secrets, Worker/Durable Object free-tier availability, Workers limits, and Pages limits against current official documentation.
- `pnpm check:deployment`: passed; the release path is manual-only, fail-closed, exact-origin, and secret-free.
- Production Worker config generation and Wrangler dry run passed with the exact CORS origin, public fetch enabled, and the SQLite Durable Object binding. Cloudflare applies its Free-plan CPU ceiling; the paid-plan-only explicit CPU field is intentionally absent and regression-tested.
- `pnpm build:production` passed with reserved test origins; 39 web artifact files passed private-file, source-map, sitemap, robots, and exact-origin CSP checks.
- `pnpm check`: passed locally: private/security/deployment/doc/format/lint/type gates, 39 Vitest files and 199 tests, 8 Playwright/axe tests, all builds, bundle budgets, and dependency audit.
- Test split: 181 unit tests and 18 integration tests passed; the integration suite now covers HTTPS-only origins, secret-free Worker generation, manual deployment policy, SPA redirects, and non-indexed local workspace routes.
- Worker dry-run output: 667.23 KiB before gzip and 107.81 KiB after gzip.
- Web production output: main JavaScript is 294.77 kB before gzip and 92.14 kB after gzip; CSS is 87.59 kB before gzip and 16.37 kB after gzip.
- Bundle budgets passed: largest JavaScript asset 287.87 KiB, all JavaScript 573.23 KiB, and largest CSS asset 85.54 KiB.
- Browser QA against the finalized production artifact covered Persian mobile at 390×844, English mobile playground, and Persian desktop at 1440×900. Direct routes, eight mobile table records, RTL/LTR, localized metadata, landmarks, footer, and absence of inspected horizontal overflow or console warnings/errors passed.
- The public repository is available at <https://github.com/pouya-fr00/ScrapeStudio> with CI, Dependabot policy, protected production secrets, release templates, and curated repository metadata.
- Cloudflare Pages is live at <https://scrapestudio.pages.dev> and the Worker API is live at <https://scrapestudio-api.pooya-fr2005.workers.dev>. The exact-origin production smoke passed for English, Persian, robots, sitemap, security headers, API health, CORS allow/deny behavior, and one approved real fetch.
- Deployment secrets remain encrypted in the GitHub `production` environment. The Cloudflare token has only Pages Write and Workers Scripts Write permissions; no secret or account identifier is committed or exposed to the browser bundle.

## Known risks

- Cloudflare limits were revalidated immediately before the 2026-07-14 deployment but remain third-party policy and must be checked again before future releases.
- Hostname resolution relies on Cloudflare's strictly-public global fetch path in addition to application-level URL and IP-literal checks; another runtime needs an equivalent DNS/rebinding defense.
- Production must configure `VITE_API_BASE_URL` when the frontend and Worker do not share an origin; local development uses the Vite API proxy.
- Table header inference and `srcset` selection are deterministic best-effort strategies rather than full browser layout reconstruction.
- Static HTML analysis cannot observe content created later by remote page JavaScript.
- IndexedDB data remains device- and browser-local and can be cleared by browser privacy settings or storage eviction; recipe JSON export is the portable backup path.
- Custom selector inspection and bounded smart-snapshot construction still run briefly on the main thread; repeated-structure scoring runs in a dedicated Worker with a hard timeout.
- Repeated-structure scores are relative heuristic rankings, not calibrated probabilities; unusual but structurally homogeneous layouts can still create false positives or false negatives.
- The live sitemap, robots reference, exact API CSP, deployed security headers, CORS boundary, health endpoint, and approved fetch path are covered by the production smoke suite.
- A production-origin Lighthouse recording is useful future performance evidence but is not a substitute for the enforced bundle budgets, automated accessibility suite, or live security smoke.
- Automated axe scans cannot replace a human screen-reader and 200% zoom review; both remain explicit pre-publication items in the release checklist.
- The source CSP remains a build template; `build:production` replaces its broad HTTPS token with the exact approved API origin and the release-artifact gate rejects any remaining wildcard.
